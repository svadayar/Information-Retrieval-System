# Information Retrieval System

This project is an Information Retrieval (IR) system designed to efficiently search and retrieve relevant documents from a corpus based on user queries. It incorporates advanced techniques such as document indexing, ranking algorithms, and summarization to enhance the retrieval process.

## Features

- **Efficient Document Indexing**: Implements a robust data structure to index documents for quick retrieval.
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Retrieves the most relevant documents corresponding to a user's query.
- **Page Ranking**: Orders retrieved documents based on their 'importance' or relevance.
- **Summarization**: Generates concise summaries for each document along with its web link.
